This is an experimental (read: not official, may change, may die and never be 
finished) implementation of a client for the Amazon EC2 Elastic Load Balancing
API for Zend Framework. 

I am writing it to scratch my own itch, but if it ever gets fully implemented
and brought-up to the ZF standards, it could be merged to become an official 
part of the Zend_Service_Amazon_Ec2 set of components. I am implementing it
to follow more or less the same interface guidelines and standards as these
existing components.
